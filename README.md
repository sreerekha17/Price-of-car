# Price-of-car
Utilizing industry standard CRISP-DM, this project showcases the factors affecting the car price

## 📘 CRISP-DM Framework: Used Car Price Analysis
### 1. Business Understanding

The client is a used car dealership seeking to understand what factors influence a car’s price.
By identifying key features that make cars more or less expensive, the dealership can:

Make smarter inventory acquisition decisions (which cars to buy and sell).

Improve pricing strategies for used vehicles.

Focus marketing on features that consumers value most.

Primary Business Question:

What characteristics of used cars are most strongly associated with higher prices?

Secondary Questions:

Does mileage have a significant effect on price?

How much does brand or model year matter?

Do transmission type, fuel type, or number of owners affect price?
